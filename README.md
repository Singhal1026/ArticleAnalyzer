# Article Analyzer ðŸ“°

This **Article Analyzer** is a powerful application that allows users to input URLs of articles, process and embed the content into a vector store, and retrieve relevant information by asking natural language questions. The tool leverages **HuggingFace embeddings, FAISS vector storage, and the Google Gemini LLM** for providing precise answers with source attribution.

## Features

- **URL Input & Processing**: Input multiple URLs to extract and preprocess the text content.
- **Document Embedding**: Transform the text into embeddings using **HuggingFace's sentence-transformers**.
- **Efficient Storage**: Store embeddings in a highly optimized FAISS vector database.
- **Natural Language Q&A**: Ask questions in plain English and get context-aware answers.
- **Source Attribution**: View sources for the answers to ensure credibility.
